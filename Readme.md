DogLcd
======
DogLcd is an Arduino library for the Dog Text-LCD modules manufactured by  
[Electronic Assembly](http://www.lcd-module.com/products/dog.html "Electronic Assembly Website").

DogLcds are an interesting option for development because
* the displays are available with 1, 2 and 3 lines of characters
* can be combined with Led backlights in 5 different colors
* are not too expensive
* only require 4 Arduino IO-pins to control the display (SPI-mode)
* and you can connect more than one display to your arduino (where each new display will require one more IO-Pin)
